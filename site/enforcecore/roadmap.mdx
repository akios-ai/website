- 867 tests

### v1.0.12a1 — Audit Log Rotation

Size-based audit log rotation with compression.

- `AuditRotator` with configurable `max_bytes` and `max_files`
- Automatic gzip compression of rotated files
- Background rotation (non-blocking)
- 921 tests

### v1.0.13a1 — Hook System

Lifecycle hooks for extending the enforcement pipeline.

- Async-compatible hooks (sync and async functions)
- Priority ordering for hook execution
- 985 tests

### v1.0.14a1 — Observability (OpenTelemetry)

First-class OpenTelemetry integration for production monitoring.

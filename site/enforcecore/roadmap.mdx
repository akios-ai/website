# Roadmap

EnforceCore ships incrementally. Each release adds one well-tested, well-documented component. No release ships without full test coverage, updated documentation, and passing CI.

---

## Released Versions

### v1.0.0 — Core Enforcer + Policy Engine

The foundation. Minimal viable enforcement framework.

- `@enforce(policy=...)` decorator (sync + async)
- `enforce()` context manager
- Policy Engine with Pydantic v2 models + YAML loading
- Pre-call rule evaluation (allowed/denied tools)
- `EnforcementViolation` exception hierarchy
- Configuration via pydantic-settings
- Structured logging via structlog
- 94 tests, 97% coverage

### v1.0.1 — PII Redactor

Real-time PII detection and redaction.

- Regex-based detection — no heavy deps (no spaCy, no Presidio)
- 5 PII categories: email, phone, SSN, credit card, IP address
- 4 strategies: placeholder, mask, hash, remove
- Auto-wired into enforce pipeline (input + output)
- ~0.1–0.5ms per call
- 161 tests, 97% coverage

### v1.0.2 — Merkle Auditor

Tamper-proof, cryptographically verifiable audit trails.

- SHA-256 Merkle chain linking entries
- 14-field AuditEntry with timing and redaction stats
- Cross-session chain continuity
- `verify_trail()` with tamper detection
- JSONL format with thread-safe append
- 213 tests, 96% coverage

### v1.0.3 — Resource Guard

Cross-platform resource limits and hard termination.

- Time limits (all platforms)
- Memory limits (Linux strict, macOS advisory)
- Cumulative cost tracking with configurable budget
- KillSwitch for hard termination
- Platform detection abstraction
- 284 tests, 96% coverage

### v1.0.4 — Framework Integrations

Drop-in adapters for popular agent frameworks.

- LangGraph / LangChain adapter
- CrewAI adapter
- AutoGen adapter
- No hard dependencies on any framework
- `wrap_with_policy()` for custom adapters
- 334 tests, 96% coverage

### v1.0.5 — Evaluation Suite

Adversarial testing framework for agent containment.

- 13 adversarial scenarios across 7 threat categories
- ScenarioRunner with category/severity/tag filtering
- BenchmarkRunner with 7 per-component benchmarks
- Markdown report generation
- CLI: `enforcecore eval`

### v1.0.6 — Hardening + Polish

Production readiness and security hardening.

- Tool name validation (charset, length)
- Input size validation (10 MB default)
- Enforcement scope tracking (contextvars, max depth 10)
- Deep recursive PII redaction (nested data structures)
- Unicode hardening (NFC, homoglyphs, URL/HTML decoding)
- Dev-mode gating for fail_open
- Thread-safe policy cache
- Auditor: `max_entries` parameter, optimized resume
- **544 tests, 96% coverage**
- **Stable public API (68 exports)**

## Current Status

All v1.0.x releases have shipped. The public API is considered stable after v1.0.6.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Tests | 544 |
| Coverage | 96% |
| Public exports | 68 |
| PII categories | 5 |
| Adversarial scenarios | 13 |
| Threat categories | 7 |
| Framework adapters | 3 |
| Dependencies | 4 (Pydantic v2, PyYAML, structlog, cryptography) |

## Future Directions

These are potential future work — not committed:

### v1.1 — Network Enforcement
Domain filtering, request inspection, and network-level policy rules.

### v1.2 — Policy Hub
Community repository of reusable, audited policies.

### v1.3 — Formal Verification
Integration with model checkers for mathematical policy guarantees.

### v1.4 — Multi-Language Support
TypeScript and Go bindings for non-Python ecosystems.

### v2.0 — Distributed Enforcement
Enforcement for multi-agent systems across processes and machines.

## Tech Stack

| Dependency | Role | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Pydantic v2** | Policy validation, settings | Industry standard, fast, great DX |
| **pydantic-settings** | Configuration management | Env vars + YAML + defaults |
| **PyYAML** | Policy file loading | YAML policies are human-readable |
| **structlog** | Structured logging | Context-rich, JSON-serializable |
| **cryptography** | Merkle chain hashing | Battle-tested SHA-256 |
| **Hatch** | Build system | Modern PEP 517 builder |

### Platform Support

| Python | Linux | macOS | Windows |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3.11+ | ✓ Full | ✓ Full | ✓ Most features |

# EnforceCore

**Lightweight, open-source runtime enforcement for any Python-based AI agent.**

EnforceCore is a modular enforcement framework that intercepts every external call your agent makes — tool calls, API requests, file access — and applies mandatory policy checks, PII redaction, resource limits, and tamper-proof audit logging.

It operates at the **runtime call boundary** — the only layer that cannot be jailbroken, bypassed, or prompt-injected away.

```python
from enforcecore import enforce

@enforce(policy="policy.yaml")
async def search_web(query: str) -> str:
    return await api.search(query)

# If "search_web" is not in allowed_tools → blocked. Period.
# PII in query → auto-redacted before the call.
# Every call → cryptographic audit entry.
```

## Why EnforceCore

The AI agent ecosystem is racing to build more capable autonomous systems. But almost nobody is building the **control layer**.

Most "safety" solutions are prompt-level guardrails — suggestions to the LLM that can be bypassed, ignored, or jailbroken. They operate at the wrong layer.

**EnforceCore enforces at the code boundary.** Policies are mandatory, not advisory. If a call violates policy, it is blocked — before it ever executes.

### Enforce, don't suggest
Policies are mandatory. A denied tool call never executes. There is no "override" prompt.

### Framework-agnostic
Works with LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, or plain Python. No lock-in.

### Verifiable
Every enforced call produces a SHA-256 Merkle-chained audit entry. The full trail is tamper-proof and cryptographically verifiable.

### Lightweight
8–20ms typical overhead. Negligible compared to tool call latency (100ms–10s).

## Core Components

| Component | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Policy Engine** | Declarative YAML + Pydantic v2 policies. Allowed/denied tools, conditions, violation handling. |
| **PII Redactor** | Regex-based detection of 5 PII categories. Auto-redacts inputs and outputs. ~0.1–0.5ms per call. |
| **Merkle Auditor** | SHA-256 chained audit trail. Every call logged. Tamper detection built in. JSONL format. |
| **Resource Guard** | Time limits, memory limits, cost tracking. Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows). |
| **Integration Adapters** | Drop-in adapters for LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen. ~20–50 lines each. |
| **Evaluation Suite** | 13 adversarial scenarios across 7 threat categories. Benchmark suite with P95/P99 stats. |

## Install

```bash
pip install enforcecore
```

Python 3.11+ required. No heavy dependencies — Pydantic v2, PyYAML, structlog, cryptography.

## Quick Start

### 1. Define a policy

```yaml
# policy.yaml
name: "my-agent-policy"
version: "1.0"

rules:
  allowed_tools:
    - "search_web"
    - "calculator"
  denied_tools:
    - "execute_shell"
  pii_redaction:
    enabled: true
    categories: [email, phone, ssn]
  resource_limits:
    max_call_duration_seconds: 30
    max_cost_usd: 5.00

on_violation: "block"
```

### 2. Protect your tools

```python
from enforcecore import enforce

@enforce(policy="policy.yaml")
async def search_web(query: str) -> str:
    return await api.search(query)

@enforce(policy="policy.yaml")
def calculator(expression: str) -> str:
    return str(eval(expression))
```

### 3. Verify your audit trail

```python
from enforcecore import verify_trail

result = verify_trail("audit.jsonl")
assert result.is_valid     # True — chain intact
assert result.chain_intact  # No tampering detected
```

That's it. Three lines of enforcement code. Full policy control, PII redaction, resource limits, and a cryptographic audit trail — all automatic.

## Who is this for?

- **Agent developers** who need production-grade safety without rewriting their stack
- **Enterprises** deploying AI agents in regulated environments (finance, healthcare, legal)
- **Researchers** studying runtime verification, sandboxing, and formal guarantees for agents
- **Teams** preparing for EU AI Act compliance requirements

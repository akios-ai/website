# Installation

AKIOS V1.0 supports four official deployment methods. Choose the one that matches your security requirements and operating system.

## 1. Standalone Binary (Recommended)

**Zero setup required.** Download a single binary and run it. This is the fastest way to get started and works perfectly in air-gapped environments.

### Linux (x64)
```bash
# Download
curl -L -o akios-linux-x64 https://github.com/akios-ai/akios/releases/download/v1.0.0/akios-linux-x64

# Make executable
chmod +x akios-linux-x64

# Run
./akios-linux-x64 init my-project
```

### macOS (Universal)
```bash
# Download
curl -L -o akios-macos-universal https://github.com/akios-ai/akios/releases/download/v1.0.0/akios-macos-universal

# Make executable
chmod +x akios-macos-universal

# Run
./akios-macos-universal init my-project
```

### Windows (x64)
Download `akios-windows-x64.exe` from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/akios-ai/akios/releases).

```powershell
# Run in PowerShell
.\akios-windows-x64.exe init my-project
```

## 2. Pip Package (Python Developers)

For seamless integration with Python workflows and CI/CD pipelines.

```bash
# Install via pip
pip install akios

# Initialize project
akios init my-project
```

**Note:** On Linux, this method enforces full kernel-level sandboxing (cgroups + seccomp). On macOS/Windows, it runs with standard process isolation.

## 3. Docker Wrapper (Cross-Platform Teams)

A lightweight shell script that manages the Docker container for you. Best for teams working across different operating systems.

```bash
# Download wrapper script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akios-ai/akios/main/akios

# Verify download (~3.4KB shell script)
ls -la akios && file akios

# Make executable
chmod +x akios

# Run
./akios init my-project
```

## 4. Direct Docker (Emergency Fallback)

Use this if you cannot download the wrapper script or prefer direct container management.

```bash
# Run directly
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/app" -w /app akiosai/akios:v1.0.0 init my-project
```

## Comparison

| Method | Best For | Security | OS Support |
|--------|----------|----------|------------|
| **Binary** | **Quick Start / Air-Gapped** | High | Linux, macOS, Windows |
| **Pip** | **Python Devs / CI/CD** | **Max (Linux)** | Linux, macOS, Windows |
| **Docker** | **Cross-Platform Teams** | High (Container) | Linux, macOS, Windows |
| **Direct** | **Fallback / Automation** | High (Container) | Linux, macOS, Windows |

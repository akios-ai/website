# Security Model & Features

AKIOS V1.0 provides **strong, policy-based security** for AI agents across all platforms. The system is built around container isolation, real-time protection, and comprehensive audit trails.

## 🔒 Security Overview

AKIOS provides a "Security Cage" for your AI agents, ensuring they operate within strict boundaries.

## 📋 Supported Versions

| Version | Supported     | Security Updates |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Active     | ✅ Full Support   |
| <1.0    | ❌ End of Life| ❌ No Support    |

## 🚨 Reporting Vulnerabilities

**DO NOT report security issues on public GitHub.**

Send private reports to: **hello@akios.ai**

### What to Include
- Clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected versions
- Potential impact (e.g. sandbox bypass, PII leak)
- Suggested fix (if any)

We acknowledge reports within 24 hours and aim to triage within 72 hours.

## Security Features

### 🛡️ Container Isolation
- **Policy-based sandbox**: Command allowlisting and path restrictions.
- **Resource quotas**: CPU, memory, and disk limits via cgroups v2.
- **Process isolation**: Container-based separation from the host system.
- **Network controls**: Controlled external access (default deny).

### 🔒 AI-Specific Protections
- **PII Redaction**: Automatic detection and redaction of sensitive data (50+ patterns including financial, health, and location data).
- **Cost Kill-Switches**: Automatic termination on budget violations.
- **Input Validation**: Automatic size limits and safety checks.
- **Loop Prevention**: Detection and blocking of infinite agent loops.
- **Output Sanitization**: Post-processing redaction of AI-generated content.

### 📜 Audit & Compliance
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All operations tracked with timestamps.
- **Merkle Audit Ledger**: Tamper-evident cryptographic audit trails.
- **PII-Safe Logs**: Sensitive data redacted in real-time.
- **Export Capabilities**: Reports for GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA compliance.

## Platform Security Levels

| Environment | Security Level | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| **Native Linux** | **Full (Kernel-Hard)** | Uses cgroups v2 + seccomp-bpf for maximum isolation. Recommended for high-security environments. |
| **Docker (Mac/Win/Linux)** | **Strong (Policy-Based)** | Provides strong container isolation, PII redaction, and audit trails. Does not enforce host filesystem permissions as strictly as native Linux. |

### Note on Docker Security
Docker mode provides **strong policy-based security** but cannot fully enforce host filesystem permissions (e.g., `chmod 444` bypass) or kernel-level seccomp filters on non-Linux hosts. For maximum paranoia or compliance environments, use **Native Linux**.

## What We Protect In V1.0

- **Security sandboxing**: Kernel-hard on native Linux, strong policy-based in Docker.
- **Syscall interception & resource quotas**: Preventing runaway processes.
- **Real-time PII redaction**: Protecting sensitive user data.
- **Enforced cost & loop kill-switches**: Preventing financial drain.
- **Merkle tamper-evident audit ledger**: Ensuring accountability.

**No guarantees**: No software is 100% secure. Users must secure their environment and validate outputs.

## Verifying Security

You can view the comprehensive security status and active protections using the dashboard command:

```bash
# Show detailed security dashboard
akios status --security

# Show security information in JSON format
akios status --security --json
```

### What the Dashboard Shows
- **Security Level**: Full vs Strong
- **PII Protection**: Active/Inactive
- **Network Access**: Allowed/Blocked
- **Audit Logging**: Trail Status
- **Cost Controls**: Budget Limits

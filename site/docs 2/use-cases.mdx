# Use Cases & Examples

Where AKIOS fits in your infrastructure and day-to-day workflows.

## Core Scenarios

### Running 3rd-Party Agents
When you download an agent from a marketplace or a community repo, you can't be sure what it does. AKIOS lets you run these agents safely on your local machine or dev server without risking your data.

### CI/CD Pipelines
Integrate AKIOS into your CI/CD pipeline to test agents before deploying them. You can verify that an agent adheres to its declared policies (for example, it doesn't try to access the internet if it shouldn't).

### Data Processing Jobs
Run sensitive data processing tasks in an ephemeral, network-isolated environment to ensure no data leaks occur during processing.

## Real-World Examples

Specific examples of how the security cage solves practical problems.

### 1. Secure Incoming Document Processing (Public Sector)

**Problem**: Government agencies receive citizen documents containing sensitive PII (names, SSNs).
**Solution**: Read document -> Redact PII -> Summarize with LLM -> Save.

```yaml
name: "Secure Document Summary"
description: "Redacts PII and summarizes a PDF."
steps:
  - step: "read_pdf"
    agent: "filesystem"
    action: "read"
    parameters:
      path: "/inputs/application.txt"

  - step: "analyze"
    agent: "llm"
    action: "complete"
    parameters:
      model: "gpt-4"
      # PII redaction happens automatically here by the cage
      prompt: "Summarize this application: {{read_pdf.content}}"

  - step: "save"
    agent: "filesystem"
    action: "write"
    parameters:
      path: "/outputs/summary.txt"
      content: "{{analyze.text}}"
```

**Value**: GDPR-compliant processing with verifiable audit trails.

### 2. External API Enrichment (Finance)

**Problem**: Enrich client data via external API without exposing PII or exceeding budget.
**Solution**: Fetch Data -> Redact -> Enrich -> Cost Kill-Switch.

```yaml
name: "KYC Enrichment"
description: "Fetches user data and analyzes risk."
steps:
  - step: "fetch_data"
    agent: "http"
    action: "get"
    parameters:
      url: "https://api.external-data.com/user/{{user_id}}"

  - step: "risk_analysis"
    agent: "llm"
    action: "complete"
    parameters:
      model: "claude-3-opus"
      prompt: "Analyze risk for this user data: {{fetch_data.body}}"

  - step: "save_report"
    agent: "filesystem"
    action: "write"
    parameters:
      path: "/reports/{{user_id}}_risk.json"
      content: "{{risk_analysis.text}}"
```

**Value**: Strict cost control ($1.00 limit) and PII protection for sensitive financial data.

### 3. Secure Tool Execution (DevOps)

**Problem**: Run a Python script to analyze logs without giving it full system access.
**Solution**: Tool Agent with strict command allowlist.

```yaml
name: "Log Analyzer"
description: "Runs a python script to parse logs."
steps:
  - step: "run_script"
    agent: "tool_executor"
    action: "run"
    parameters:
      command: "python3 /scripts/analyze_logs.py --input /logs/server.log"
```

**Value**: The script cannot access the network or files outside the allowed paths.

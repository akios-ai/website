    Today we are announcing AKIOS, a new open-source runtime designed specifically for running untrusted AI agents on local machines.
  </p>

  <h2>The Problem: "curl | sh" for Agents</h2>
  <p>
    We are entering an era where developers routinely run AI agents that generate and execute code. Current practices often involve running these agents directly on the host machine or inside loosely configured Docker containers.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is risky. Agents can hallucinate destructive commands, exfiltrate credentials, or accidentally modify critical system files. We need a runtime that assumes the agent is untrusted by default.
  </p>

  <h2>Enter AKIOS</h2>
  <p>
    AKIOS provides a strict sandbox based on <code>seccomp-bpf</code> and user namespaces. It follows a "deny-by-default" philosophy for both network and filesystem access.
  </p>

  <h3>Key Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Strict Sandboxing:</strong> Agents run in isolated environments with minimal privileges.</li>
    <li><strong>Explicit Policies:</strong> You define exactly which domains an agent can contact and which files it can read/write.</li>
    <li><strong>Auditable Logs:</strong> Every action taken by the agent is logged and signed, providing a verifiable audit trail.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What's Next?</h2>
  <p>
    This is just the beginning. We are working on advanced features like multi-agent orchestration and hardware-accelerated inference within the sandbox.

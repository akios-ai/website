    One of the biggest challenges in building multi-agent systems is allowing agents to talk to each other without opening up security holes. Here's how AKIOS solves this with capability-based channels.
  </p>

  <h2>The IPC Dilemma</h2>
  <p>
    Traditional Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms like shared memory or named pipes are fast but dangerous. If Agent A can write to Agent B's memory, it can potentially hijack Agent B's control flow.
  </p>
  <p>
    In AKIOS, we use a different approach: <strong>Mediated Message Passing</strong>.
  </p>

  <pre><code>// Example: Defining a secure channel in AKIOS policy
allow_channel {
  from: "agent-a",
  to: "agent-b",
  protocol: "json-rpc",
  max_rate: "100/s"
}</code></pre>

  <p>
    This policy explicitly defines that Agent A can send JSON-RPC messages to Agent B, but only up to 100 messages per second. The AKIOS kernel enforces this limit and validates the protocol headers before the message ever reaches Agent B.
  </p>

  <h2>Zero-Copy, Zero-Trust</h2>
  <p>
    Despite the mediation, performance remains high thanks to our zero-copy ring buffer implementation. We map read-only pages into the receiver's address space, ensuring that data is never copied unnecessarily, but also cannot be modified by the sender after transmission.
  </p>

  <h3>Benchmarks</h3>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Method</th>
        <th>Latency (p99)</th>
        <th>Throughput</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Unix Domain Sockets</td>
        <td>12µs</td>
        <td>4.5 GB/s</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>AKIOS Channels</td>
        <td>14µs</td>
        <td>4.2 GB/s</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>HTTP/REST (Localhost)</td>
        <td>150µs</td>
        <td>0.8 GB/s</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>
    We achieve near-native IPC performance while maintaining strict isolation boundaries. This allows you to build complex agent swarms where a compromised agent cannot laterally move to infect others.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Security shouldn't come at the cost of performance. With AKIOS channels, you get the best of both worlds.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is AKIOS?

AKIOS is a security-first runtime for AI agent workflows. It's not an agent framework — it's a security cage that wraps around agents, enforcing strict policies, sandboxing, PII redaction, and audit logging.

### What's the strongest security setup?

**Maximum security:** Pip installation on native Linux with:
- Kernel >= 5.4
- cgroups v2 (resource limits)
- seccomp-bpf (syscall filtering)

**Strong security:** Docker wrapper on macOS/Windows/Linux provides:
- Container isolation
- Policy-based security
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Where are my workflow outputs?

Outputs are organized by run:
```
data/output/
└── run_2024-01-15_10-30-45/    # Each run gets its own folder
    ├── result.txt
    └── metadata.json
```

Audit logs are in:
```
audit/
└── audit_events.jsonl        # Tamper-evident logs
```

### How do I switch from mock to real APIs?

**Option 1: Command flag**
```bash
akios run workflow.yml --real-api
```

**Option 2: Environment variable**
```bash
export AKIOS_MOCK_LLM=0
export AKIOS_NETWORK_ACCESS_ALLOWED=1
akios run workflow.yml
```

**Option 3: Config file**
```yaml
# config.yaml
network_access_allowed: true
```

### How do I check my security status?

```bash
# Overall status
akios status

# Detailed security info
akios status --security

# Verify audit log integrity
akios audit verify
```

### What if my workflow fails validation?

Workflows must have this structure:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: "Step name"
    agent: "filesystem"     # Required: filesystem, http, llm, tool_executor
    action: "read"          # Required: agent-specific action
    parameters:             # Required: action-specific parameters
      path: "data/input/file.txt"
```

**Common issues:**
- Missing `agent`, `action`, or `parameters`
- Invalid agent name
- Disallowed file path
- Unsupported model name

See [Policy Schema](policy-schema.html) for complete reference.

### Can I use AKIOS offline?

Partially:
- ✅ **Install offline:** Package pip files or Docker image
- ✅ **Run workflows offline:** Filesystem and tool agents work
- ❌ **LLM calls:** Require API access (local models planned for future)
- ❌ **HTTP requests:** Require network

For air-gapped environments, see [Deployment Guide](deployment.html#air-gapped-deployments).

### How much does AKIOS cost?

AKIOS itself is free and open-source. You only pay for:
- AI API calls (OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok, etc.)
- Cloud hosting (if you deploy to cloud)

Set budget limits to control AI costs:
```yaml
budget_limit_per_run: 1.0  # USD
```

### What AI providers are supported?

- **OpenAI:** gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4, gpt-4o
- **Anthropic:** claude-3.5-haiku, claude-3.5-sonnet
- **Grok:** grok-3
- **Mistral:** mistral-large
- **Gemini:** gemini-1.5-pro

See [Installation](installation.html) for setup instructions.

### Can I write custom agents?

V1.0 focuses on the four core agents (filesystem, http, llm, tool_executor). Custom agents are planned for future versions.

For now, use tool_executor agent to run custom commands:
```yaml
steps:
  - agent: tool_executor
    action: run
    parameters:
      command: ["python", "my_script.py"]
```

### How do I report security issues?

Email: **hello@akios.ai**

For vulnerability reports, see [Security Policy](security.html).

## Glossary

### Security Cage
The complete security layer AKIOS enforces around every workflow:
- Sandbox isolation (process/container)
- Policy enforcement (allowed paths, actions)
- PII redaction (sensitive data removal)
- Audit logging (tamper-evident trail)

### Policy-Based vs Kernel-Hard Security

**Policy-based (Docker):**
- Container isolation
- Network policies
- Resource limits
- Works on macOS/Windows/Linux

**Kernel-hard (Linux native):**
- All policy-based features PLUS:
- seccomp-bpf syscall filtering
- cgroups v2 resource limits
- Maximum security

### Allowed Paths
Explicit filesystem allowlist for the filesystem agent. Only these directories can be accessed:

```yaml
filesystem:
  allowed_paths:
    - "./data/input"
    - "./data/output"
```

Anything outside these paths is denied.

### PII Redaction
Real-time masking, hashing, or removal of sensitive patterns:

**Redacts 50+ pattern types:**
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Credit cards
- Social Security Numbers
- API keys
- Passwords
- And more...

**Strategies:**
- `mask` - Replace with `[REDACTED]`
- `hash` - Replace with SHA256 hash
- `remove` - Delete entirely

### Merkle Audit
Tamper-evident log chain where each log entry contains:
- Event data (what happened)
- Timestamp (when)
- Hash of previous entry (creates chain)

```bash
# Verify integrity
akios audit verify
```

If any log entry is modified, verification fails.

### Mock vs Real API Mode

**Mock mode (AKIOS_MOCK_LLM=1):**
- Returns synthetic responses
- No API calls
- No cost
- Good for testing

**Real API mode (AKIOS_MOCK_LLM=0):**
- Calls actual AI providers
- Has cost
- Budget limits enforced
- PII redaction active

### Budget Kill-Switch
Hard limits that stop workflows automatically:

```yaml
budget_limit_per_run: 1.0      # USD
max_tokens_per_call: 500        # tokens
cost_kill_enabled: true         # auto-terminate
```

Prevents runaway costs from infinite loops or excessive API calls.

### Agents
The four core primitives for building workflows:

**📚 filesystem** - File operations
- read, write, list, stat, exists
- Restricted to allowed_paths

**🌐 http** - Web requests
- GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- Rate limited and redacted

**🤖 llm** - AI models
- generate, chat, complete
- Budget tracked

**🛠️ tool_executor** - Safe commands
- run allowlisted commands
- Sandboxed subprocess

No arbitrary code execution — only these four agents.

### Workflow
YAML file defining a sequence of agent actions:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: "Read document"
    agent: filesystem
    action: read
    parameters:
      path: "data/input/doc.txt"
      
  - name: "Analyze with AI"
    agent: llm
    action: generate
    parameters:
      prompt: "Summarize: {previous_output}"
```

### Security Context
The combined security state for a workflow run:
- Sandbox status (enabled/disabled)
- Allowed paths
- Network access (allowed/blocked)
- Budget limits
- PII redaction rules

Displayed with `akios status --security`

### Audit Event
Single entry in the audit log:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45Z",
  "workflow": "process-document.yml",
  "agent": "llm",
  "action": "generate",
  "user": "user123",
  "cost": 0.05,
  "hash_chain": "abc123..."
}
```

### Run Directory
Output folder for single workflow execution:

```
data/output/run_2024-01-15_10-30-45/
├── result.txt          # Workflow outputs
├── metadata.json      # Run metadata
└── audit_summary.json # Audit summary
```

Each run is isolated and timestamped.

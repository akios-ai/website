# Security Features

AKIOS protects your AI workflows with multiple layers of defense. This guide explains what security you get and how to verify it's working.

## What AKIOS Protects Against

**Data Leaks** → Automatic PII redaction before data reaches AI providers  
**Cost Overruns** → Hard budget limits with automatic termination  
**Resource Abuse** → CPU, memory, and disk quotas  
**Unauthorized Access** → Sandbox isolation and path restrictions  
**Audit Gaps** → Complete tamper-evident logging of all actions

## Security By Platform

| Platform | Security Level | What You Get |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Native Linux + sudo** | Full (kernel-hard) | cgroups v2 + seccomp-bpf syscall filtering = maximum isolation |
| **Native Linux (no sudo)** | Strong (graceful degradation) | Policy-based sandbox with most protections active |
| **Docker** (all platforms) | Strong (policy-based) | Container isolation + command allowlisting = excellent cross-platform security |

**Both are production-ready.** Use native Linux for absolute maximum, Docker for excellent security everywhere.

## The Four Security Layers

### 0. Security Cage

The Security Cage is the core abstraction — a controlled environment where AI workflows execute with full protections active.

**Activate the cage:**
```bash
# Activate full security: PII redaction, network lock, sandbox, audit
akios cage up

# Check current security posture
akios cage status

# Run diagnostics
akios doctor
```

When the cage is **ACTIVE**, these protections are enforced:
- **PII Redaction** — All inputs/outputs automatically scanned and redacted
- **Network Lock** — Only LLM API endpoints + configured `allowed_domains` pass through
- **Sandbox** — Process isolation via cgroups v2 + seccomp-bpf (native) or container policy (Docker)
- **Audit Logging** — Every action cryptographically logged with Merkle chains
- **Cost Controls** — Budget kill-switches halt execution if limits exceeded

**Deactivate the cage:**
```bash
# Full cage down — destroy ALL session data (default)
akios cage down

# Multi-pass secure erasure (DOD 5220.22-M)
akios cage down --passes 3

# Fast teardown (truncate-only, dev/CI)
akios cage down --fast

# Dev mode — relax protections but keep data for debugging
akios cage down --keep-data
```

> **Warning:** `cage down` permanently destroys `audit/`, `data/output/`, and `data/input/`. This is the cage's core security promise: zero data residue when the cage goes down. Use `--keep-data` only during active development.

**Ablation flags:** Benchmark the overhead of individual cage components by selectively disabling them:

```bash
akios cage up --no-pii      # Disable PII redaction only
akios cage up --no-audit    # Disable audit only
akios cage up --no-budget   # Disable budget enforcement only
```

These flags are for benchmarking and testing only — never use them in production.

### 1. Sandbox & Isolation

**What it does:** Keeps AI agents in a controlled environment

- **Process isolation** - Agents can't access the host system
- **Syscall filtering** - Dangerous system calls are blocked (Linux)
- **Resource limits** - CPU/memory quotas prevent exhaustion
- **Path restrictions** - Only allowed directories accessible
- **Network control** - Default deny, explicit allow only

**Verify it's working:**
```bash
akios status --security
# Look for: Security Level: Full (Linux) or Strong (Docker)
```

### 2. PII Redaction

**What it does:** Automatically removes sensitive data

**Protected data types (53 patterns across 6 categories):**
- Email addresses, phone numbers
- Social Security numbers, credit cards
- API keys, passwords, tokens
- IP addresses, MAC addresses
- Medical records, health data (NPI, DEA, MRN)
- Financial account numbers
- Insurance data (policy numbers, group numbers, claim numbers, prior-authorization numbers)

**Applied twice:**
- Before sending to AI providers (inputs)
- After receiving from AI providers (outputs)

**Pluggable PII backend:** AKIOS uses a `PIIDetectorProtocol` interface, allowing custom PII detection implementations. The default regex-based detector covers 53 patterns with >95% accuracy.

**Context keywords:** Reduce false-positive PII matches by requiring contextual keywords near a pattern match. Configure `context_keywords` in your policy to require words like "SSN", "social security", or "tax ID" near a numeric pattern before flagging it.

**Verify it's working:**
```bash
akios status --security
# Look for: PII Protection: Active (inputs + outputs)
```

**PII marker format:** Detected PII is replaced with typed markers using guillemet notation:

| PII Type | Marker | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Email | `«EMAIL»` | john@example.com → `«EMAIL»` |
| SSN | `«SSN»` | 442-01-9821 → `«SSN»` |
| Phone | `«PHONE»` | (319) 555-1701 → `«PHONE»` |
| Name | `«NAME»` | James T. Kirk → `«NAME»` |
| Address | `«ADDRESS»` | 1701 Enterprise Way → `«ADDRESS»` |
| Credit Card | `«CREDIT_CARD»` | 4111-1111-1111-1111 → `«CREDIT_CARD»` |
| NPI | `«NPI»` | 1234567890 → `«NPI»` |
| DEA | `«DEA»` | AB1234567 → `«DEA»` |
| MRN | `«MRN»` | MRN-2024-001 → `«MRN»` |

**Scan files before processing:**
```bash
akios protect scan data/input/document.txt
akios protect preview templates/workflow.yml
```

**PII fail-safe:** If the PII scanner itself encounters an error during processing, the entire input/output is blocked rather than passed through unredacted. This fail-closed behavior ensures sensitive data never leaks due to scanner failures.

```bash
# Inspect PII prompt template
akios protect show-prompt
```

### 3. Cost Kill-Switches

**What it does:** Prevents surprise AI bills

- **Default budget:** $1.00 per workflow
- **Token limits:** 1000 tokens per API call (default)
- **Automatic termination:** Workflow stops if budget exceeded
- **Loop detection:** Catches infinite loops before costs spiral

**Verify it's working:**
```bash
akios status
# Look for: Budget: $0.12 / $1.00 remaining
```

### 4. Audit Trail

**What it does:** Creates tamper-evident logs

- **Cryptographic integrity** - Merkle-style hash chains
- **Complete coverage** - Every action logged
- **PII-safe** - Sensitive data redacted in logs
- **Compliance ready** - Export for SOX/HIPAA/GDPR

**Verify it's working:**
```bash
akios logs --limit 5
# You should see recent actions with timestamps
```

**Audit management:**
```bash
# Rotate audit log — archive current chain, start fresh
akios audit rotate

# View aggregate audit statistics
akios audit stats
```

## HTTPS Enforcement

All external API calls made by AKIOS are restricted to HTTPS. Plain HTTP requests are rejected at the transport layer. This applies to:
- LLM provider calls (OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok, Mistral, Gemini)
- HTTP agent requests to `allowed_domains`
- Any external call made within the security cage

There is no option to downgrade to HTTP. This is a structural guarantee, not a configuration choice.

## Check Your Security Status

**Quick check:**
```bash
akios status
```

Shows: Security level, PII protection, budget remaining, audit status

**Detailed security dashboard:**
```bash
akios status --security
```

Shows: All security features, active protections, compliance indicators, resource limits

**Machine-readable (for scripts):**
```bash
akios status --security --json
```

## What to Expect

### On Native Linux
```
🛡️ Security Level: Full (kernel-hard)
✓ Sandbox: cgroups v2 + seccomp-bpf active
✓ PII Redaction: Active (inputs + outputs)
✓ Audit Logging: Cryptographic integrity verified
✓ Network: Denied (unless explicitly enabled)
✓ Cost Controls: $1.00 budget limit active
```

**Requirements:** Linux kernel 5.4+, system packages `libseccomp-dev` and `python3-seccomp`, sudo privileges for full kernel-hard protection. Without sudo, AKIOS gracefully degrades to policy-based mode.

### On Docker (any platform)
```
🛡️ Security Level: Strong (policy-based)
✓ Sandbox: Container isolation active
✓ PII Redaction: Active (inputs + outputs)
✓ Audit Logging: Cryptographic integrity verified
✓ Network: Denied (unless explicitly enabled)
✓ Cost Controls: $1.00 budget limit active
```

## Security Best Practices

**√ Do:**
- Run `akios status --security` regularly
- Keep AKIOS updated to latest version
- Review audit logs periodically
- Set appropriate budget limits
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Run in isolated environments for sensitive work

**× Don't:**
- Commit `.env` files to version control
- Disable PII redaction in production
- Run with unlimited budgets
- Ignore security warnings
- Share API keys in logs or outputs

## Deployable Output

Every workflow execution produces a structured `output.json` artifact:

```bash
akios output latest
```

The output includes: metadata (version, workflow name, ID, timestamp), execution details (status, steps, timing), security state (PII redaction, audit, sandbox), cost breakdown (total, budget, remaining, over-budget flag), and per-step results with agent, action, status, timing, and output text. Designed for CI/CD pipeline integration.

## Data Lifecycle

The cage enforces a strict data lifecycle:

```
cage up → protections activate → workflows execute → data generated
                                                           ↓
cage down → audit/ destroyed → data/output/ destroyed → data/input/ destroyed
                                                           ↓
                                                    ZERO DATA RESIDUE
```

Every session starts clean and ends clean. No sensitive artifacts survive a cage session.

## Network Security & HTTPS Whitelist

By default, **all external network access is blocked** (secure-first design). LLM API endpoints (OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok, Mistral, Gemini) always pass through regardless of this setting — the `network_access_allowed` controls only the HTTP agent.

**Configure an HTTPS whitelist for the HTTP agent:**

```yaml
# config.yaml
network_access_allowed: true
allowed_domains:
  - "api.salesforce.com"
  - "api.mycompany.com"
```

Or via environment variable:
```bash
AKIOS_ALLOWED_DOMAINS="api.salesforce.com,api.mycompany.com"
```

Subdomains must be added explicitly — they are not automatically allowed.

## Compliance Frameworks

AKIOS audit exports are designed for regulatory examination across sectors:

| Sector | Regulation | Compliance Features |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Healthcare | HIPAA, HITECH | PHI redaction (NPI/DEA/MRN), access logging, audit proof |
| Banking | PCI-DSS, BSA-AML, GLBA | Financial PII redaction, transaction audit |
| Insurance | NAIC, State DOI | Claim data protection, fraud detection audit |
| Accounting | SOX 302/404, PCAOB | Financial audit trail, control verification |
| Government | FISMA, FedRAMP, Privacy Act | Clearance data protection, access audit |
| Legal | ABA Rule 1.6, FRE 502 | Privilege protection, case data redaction |
| EU/France | RGPD, CNIL, ANSSI | DCP redaction, RGS compliance, data lifecycle |

**Weighted compliance scoring:** AKIOS computes a compliance readiness score based on which security components are active. Weights: **security 50%**, **audit 30%**, **cost 20%**. Each component is weighted by its contribution to a given regulatory framework. Run `akios status --security` to see your current compliance score.

## Non-Root Docker Containers

As of v1.0.10, the official AKIOS Docker image runs as a non-root `akios` user by default. Containers no longer run as root, reducing the blast radius of any container escape vulnerability.

```bash
# Official image — already non-root
docker run --rm akiosai/akios:v{{version}} status

# Verify
docker run --rm akiosai/akios:v{{version}} id
# uid=1000(akios) gid=1000(akios)
```

## Safe Condition Evaluator

Workflow `condition` fields are evaluated using an **AST-based safe evaluator** (v1.0.10). This replaces the previous `eval()` + token blocklist approach, eliminating code injection risk entirely.

The evaluator supports:
- Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- Boolean operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
- String operations: `in`, `not in`
- Variable references: `previous_output`, step outputs

Arbitrary Python code is **not** executed — only safe expressions are evaluated.

## TLA+ Formal Verification

AKIOS includes a 130-line TLA+ specification that formally verifies the safety invariants of the enforcement pipeline. The specification has been model-checked to prove:

- **No PII leakage** — data is always redacted before leaving the cage
- **Budget enforcement** — workflows are always terminated when budget is exceeded
- **Audit completeness** — every action is logged before execution proceeds
- **Sandbox integrity** — isolation constraints are never weakened during execution

See `docs/tla/AKIOSEnforcement.tla` in the repository.

# Security Features

AKIOS protects your AI workflows with multiple layers of defense. This guide explains what security you get and how to verify it's working.

## What AKIOS Protects Against

**Data Leaks** → Automatic PII redaction before data reaches AI providers  
**Cost Overruns** → Hard budget limits with automatic termination  
**Resource Abuse** → CPU, memory, and disk quotas  
**Unauthorized Access** → Sandbox isolation and path restrictions  
**Audit Gaps** → Complete tamper-evident logging of all actions

## Security By Platform

| Platform | Security Level | What You Get |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Native Linux** | Full (kernel-hard) | cgroups v2 + seccomp-bpf syscall filtering = maximum isolation |
| **Docker** (all platforms) | Strong (policy-based) | Container isolation + command allowlisting = excellent cross-platform security |

**Both are production-ready.** Use native Linux for absolute maximum, Docker for excellent security everywhere.

## The Four Security Layers

### 1. Sandbox & Isolation

**What it does:** Keeps AI agents in a controlled environment

- **Process isolation** - Agents can't access the host system
- **Syscall filtering** - Dangerous system calls are blocked (Linux)
- **Resource limits** - CPU/memory quotas prevent exhaustion
- **Path restrictions** - Only allowed directories accessible
- **Network control** - Default deny, explicit allow only

**Verify it's working:**
```bash
akios status --security
# Look for: Security Level: Full (Linux) or Strong (Docker)
```

### 2. PII Redaction

**What it does:** Automatically removes sensitive data

**Protected data types (50+ patterns):**
- Email addresses, phone numbers
- Social Security numbers, credit cards
- API keys, passwords, tokens
- IP addresses, MAC addresses
- Medical records, health data
- Financial account numbers

**Applied twice:**
- Before sending to AI providers (inputs)
- After receiving from AI providers (outputs)

**Verify it's working:**
```bash
akios status --security
# Look for: PII Protection: Active (inputs + outputs)
```

### 3. Cost Kill-Switches

**What it does:** Prevents surprise AI bills

- **Default budget:** $1.00 per workflow
- **Token limits:** 1000 tokens per API call (default)
- **Automatic termination:** Workflow stops if budget exceeded
- **Loop detection:** Catches infinite loops before costs spiral

**Verify it's working:**
```bash
akios status
# Look for: Budget: $0.12 / $1.00 remaining
```

### 4. Audit Trail

**What it does:** Creates tamper-evident logs

- **Cryptographic integrity** - Merkle-style hash chains
- **Complete coverage** - Every action logged
- **PII-safe** - Sensitive data redacted in logs
- **Compliance ready** - Export for SOX/HIPAA/GDPR

**Verify it's working:**
```bash
akios logs --limit 5
# You should see recent actions with timestamps
```

## Check Your Security Status

**Quick check:**
```bash
akios status
```

Shows: Security level, PII protection, budget remaining, audit status

**Detailed security dashboard:**
```bash
akios status --security
```

Shows: All security features, active protections, compliance indicators, resource limits

**Machine-readable (for scripts):**
```bash
akios status --security --json
```

## What to Expect

### On Native Linux
```
🛡️ Security Level: Full (kernel-hard)
✓ Sandbox: cgroups v2 + seccomp-bpf active
✓ PII Redaction: Active (inputs + outputs)
✓ Audit Logging: Cryptographic integrity verified
✓ Network: Denied (unless explicitly enabled)
✓ Cost Controls: $1.00 budget limit active
```

### On Docker (any platform)
```
🛡️ Security Level: Strong (policy-based)
✓ Sandbox: Container isolation active
✓ PII Redaction: Active (inputs + outputs)
✓ Audit Logging: Cryptographic integrity verified
✓ Network: Denied (unless explicitly enabled)
✓ Cost Controls: $1.00 budget limit active
```

## Security Best Practices

**√ Do:**
- Run `akios status --security` regularly
- Keep AKIOS updated to latest version
- Review audit logs periodically
- Set appropriate budget limits
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Run in isolated environments for sensitive work

**× Don't:**
- Commit `.env` files to version control
- Disable PII redaction in production
- Run with unlimited budgets
- Ignore security warnings
- Share API keys in logs or outputs

## Report Security Issues

**Found a vulnerability?** Email **hello@akios.ai** (private only)

**Include:**
- Clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected versions
- Potential impact (sandbox bypass, PII leak, cost overrun)
- Your contact info

**Our response:**
- Acknowledgment within 24 hours
- Triage within 72 hours
- Fix in 2-4 weeks (depending on severity)
- Coordinated disclosure
- Public credit (Hall of Fame)

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported | Security Updates |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| 1.0.x | ✅ Active | ✅ Full support |
| <1.0 | ❌ End of Life | ❌ No support |

Always use the latest 1.0.x version for best security.
